# exploratory-data-analysis---online-shopping-in-retail917
## Description
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project was part of AiCore's training for their Data Analysis course. The purpose is to provide real-world experience of data analysis by exploring a dataset of online shopping website activity. 

The project will showcase the power of EDA in uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and how these insights can be leveraged to drive business success. 

The data contains information about the website activity of users over one year. Each sample represents the user interacting with the website during a shopping session. 

A variety of statistical and visualisation techniques will be used to explore the data. The analysis will provide a better understanding of customer behaviour but also help the business optimise marketing strategies and improve their customer experience.

The project is split across 4 key milestones:
1. Setting up the environment. 
1. Extracting the online shopping data from the cloud.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
1. Analysis and Visualisation.

### What did I learn:
Below are examples of how this project has supported my learning:
1. Milestone 1:
    - How to set up a dev environment. 
    - How to set up and use git and GitHub repo for version control. 
1. Milestone 2:
    - The PyYAML package safe_load function can be used to securely load security credentials, returning them as a dictionary. 
    - The unpacking operator (**) can be used to unpack a dictionary into keyword arguments of a function. This was useful for creating the database URL.
    - How to use the sqlalchemy create_engine function to create a Dialect object tailored towards PostgreSQL, as well as a Pool object which establishes a DBAPI connection.
1. Milestone 3:
